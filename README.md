# Movie Data

## Summary

For this project we wanted to see if we could find any correlation between a movie's attribute and it's overall success (total gross). To do this, we formed one dataset by joining multiple sets of data ranging from already made csv's to web scrapping the Box Office Mojo website. From this main dataset we were able to filter through a movie's attribute to see if affected a movie's success. We then used Matplotlib to create graphs to further explore our findings.

We decided that this data is better presented visually because some of the movie's attributes are qualitative, and some of these qualitative measures affect other aspects to a film; such as genre. The data is easier to make sense of when filtered down into separate groups and charted side by side.
